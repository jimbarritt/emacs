  Prefixed with \\[universal-argument], expand the file name to

  Prefixed with \\[negative-argument], use relative path to file
  name from current directory, `default-directory'.  See
  `file-relative-name'.

  The default with no prefix is to insert the file name exactly as
  it appears in the minibuffer prompt."

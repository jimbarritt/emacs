Slightly More Useful Mac characters

Unicode does define some other characters which are sort of Mac-specific.
⌘ - &#x2318; - &#8984; - the Command Key symbol
⌥ - &#x2325; - &#8997; - the Option Key symbol
⇧ - &#x21E7; - &#8679; - the Shift Key (really just an outline up-arrow, not Mac-specific)
⎋ - &#x238B; - &#9099; - the Escape Key (also not Mac-specific; described as "BROKEN CIRCLE WITH NORTHWEST ARROW", or an escape character from ISO 9995-7). I originally thought this was supposed to be a symbol for the power button.

And while we're at it, some related (not mac-specific):
⇥ - &#x21E5; - &#8677; - the Tab Key symbol
⏎ - &#x23CE; - &#9166; - the Return Key symbol
⌫ - &#x232B; - &#9003; - the Delete Key symbol
⌽ - &#x233D; - &#9021; - a possible substitute for the Power symbol


The apple logo is supposed to be in:

U+F8FF (decimal value 63743, or on the web as either &#xF8FF; or &#63743;)

But not all fonts use it.
